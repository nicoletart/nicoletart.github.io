        <h2>The Task</h2>

          <p>In Winter and Spring 2022 quarters, I was a part of a front-end team to create an environmental calculator.
            My team and I worked on this project for Chicago Furniture Bank. The goal of Chicago Furniture Bank is to receive
            donations of furniture and give it to those in need in Chicago. The executives wanted us to create a front-end calculator,
            where clients could go on and hypothetically state how much furniture they want to donate (for example, 10 beds or 5 chairs).
            This would output the environmental impact of donating this furniture. This would show clients the benefit of donating to CFB. 
          </p>

          <h2>The Result</h2>
          <p>First, my team and I created a Figma outline of the design we want for the calculator. After
            we split up the website into 5 parts so we can each work on one aspect of the design. For me, I worked on creating
            the header and banner of the calculator. In addition, I helped to code the pie chart of the environmental impact
            of donating the furniture.
          </p>

          <p>With our design, the way the clients would hypothetically donate furniture is with 16 sliders, each associated with a furniture.
            After sliding each one, the pie chart would automatically recalibrate and show the environmental impact of their donation
        (such as how much carbon they are saving) </p>
