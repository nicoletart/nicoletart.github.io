          <p>Hello! My name is Nicole Tartakovsky, and I use she/her pronouns. Currently, I'm a second year
            at Northwestern University. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology.
          </p>

          <h2>Personal</h2>
          <p>I grew up in Chicago suburbs and always had a love for technology. Outside of computer science, I love playing tennis, listening to music, and watching romantic comedy movies. 
            At Northwestern, I'm a part of Society of Women Engineers and Women in Computing.
          </p>

          <h2>Research</h2>

         <p> I am a part of research looking at the intersection of computer science and sports. High school and middle school students
            may feel that if they are only successful in one of these two areas, they aren't great in the other area. The research
            I am a part of is trying to bridge this gap. Specifically, I am working to create a ball tracking application that can be 
            used in the application Scratch. </p>
